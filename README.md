This package provides an async timer object, that should have been part of batteries.

## Purpose

Sometimes, you need a way to make something happen over and over again at certain times, like updating information or sending reminders. That's where Async Timer comes in. It lets you set up these repeated actions easily.

This package is particularly useful for tasks like automatically updating caches in the background without disrupting the primary application's workflow.

## Features

* **Zero Dependencies**: Written entirely in Python, Async Timer operates independently without needing any external libraries.
* **Versatility in Callables**: It accommodates various callable types, including:
  * Synchronous functions
  * Asynchronous functions
  * Synchronous generators
  * Asynchronous generators
* **Wait for the Next Tick**: You can set it up so your program waits for the timer to do its thing, and then continues.
* **Keep Getting Updates**: You can use it in a loop to keep getting updates every time the timer goes off.

## Example Usage

### FastAPI

This snippet starts fastapi webserver with the `refresh_db` function being executed every 5 seconds, refresing a shared `DB_CACHE` object.

```python

import contextlib
import time

import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

import async_timer

DB_CACHE = {"initialised": False}


async def refresh_db():
    global DB_CACHE
    DB_CACHE |= {"initialised": True, "cur_value": time.time()}


@contextlib.asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(_app: FastAPI):
    async with async_timer.Timer(delay=5, target=refresh_db) as timer:
        await timer.wait(hit_count=1)  # block until the timer triggers at least once
        yield


app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World", "db_cache": DB_CACHE}


if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

```

### join()
```python

import async_timer

timer = async_timer.Timer(12, target=lambda: 42)
timer.start()
val = await timer.join()  # `val` will be set to 42 after 12 seconds
```

### for loop
```python
# Async for loop example
import async_timer
import time
with async_timer.Timer(14, target=time.time) as timer:
    async for time_rv in timer:
        print(f"{time_rv=}")  # Prints current time every 14 seconds

```
